# Water-Analysis
Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses on water data

Water, a natural and central element in our daily lives, can take many forms. Its mineral composition, its origin, its nature and also its hydrogen potential are all parameters that come into play in its characterization. 

The data set we have available lists nearly 100 waters (95 to be exact), described using 12 qualitative (name, nature, country) and quantitative (ionic composition, sodium, etc.) variables. This work includes the exploration of the dataset through univariate, bivariate and multidimensional (PCA) analyses.
